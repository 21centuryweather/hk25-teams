# Destination Earth with ECMWF (hk25-DestinE)

[DestineE](https://destination-earth.eu) is a an initiative of the European Commission which includes the operational provision of climate scenarios based on km-scale global models. Several multi-decadal senario simulations have been performed and are being integrated into a DestinE data platform.

In this cross-cutting activity we will adopt analyses of different science teams to the DestinE data.  One of the goals of this activity is to experiment with the capabilities of the [DestinE data platform](https://platform.destine.eu) to highlight its capabilities and bottlenecks. Another is expand the scope of the scientific analysis being performed by the science teams and begin exploring the propoerties of the DestinE models.

**Note** Special access to the DestinE data platform is being granted to participants in the Hackathon.  However those wishing to gain access need to register by 2 May, and abide by the DestinE data policies.

**Coordination**: Theresa Kiszler and Thomas Rackow (theresa.kiszler@csc.fi, thomas.rackow@ecmwf.int)

#### Sketch of initial activities:
* gain access to the DestinE platform
* identify analyses from science teams that could be executed on that platform.
* perform analyses and compare to Hackathon models
